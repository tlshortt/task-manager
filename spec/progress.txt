# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress, learnings, and patterns discovered across Ralph iterations.
Each iteration should APPEND to this file, never overwrite.

---

## Codebase Patterns

<!--
  Add patterns discovered about this codebase here.
  Future iterations read this section FIRST.
-->

- **Component Style:** React functional components with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State Management:** React useState/useContext (no external state library)
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Exports:** Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports
- **Imports:** Prefer direct imports for tree-shakable libraries (e.g. lucide-react)
- **Performance:** Use useMemo/useCallback for expensive ops and handlers passed to children

## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
  Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
  Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Remember to run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Tailwind dynamic classes need to be in safelist or use full class names
- This project uses path aliases: `@/` maps to `src/`

## 2026-01-25 - US-CAL-01
- Added ViewMode type: 'list' | 'calendar' to src/types/index.ts
- Files changed: src/types/index.ts
- No issues encountered
- Simple foundational type for calendar feature toggle

## 2026-01-25 - US-CAL-02
- Created ViewModeToggle component with List/Calendar icons
- Files changed: src/components/ViewModeToggle.tsx, src/components/index.ts
- Props: viewMode: ViewMode, onChange: (mode: ViewMode) => void
- Styled to match FilterTabs with purple highlight for active state
- Uses direct lucide-react ESM imports (List, Calendar icons)
- Component ready to be wired into MainLayout (US-CAL-03)

## 2026-01-25 - US-CAL-03
- Added viewMode state to MainLayout with useState<ViewMode>('list')
- Rendered ViewModeToggle between FilterTabs and TaskInput
- Files changed: src/components/MainLayout.tsx
- Imported ViewModeToggle component and ViewMode type
- Toggle renders and switches between List/Calendar modes
- Next step: US-CAL-04 (Calendar utilities) or later stories to wire CalendarView

## 2026-01-25 - US-CAL-04
- Created src/utils/calendarUtils.ts with CalendarDay interface and utility functions
- Implemented generateCalendarDays(month, tasks) returning 42 CalendarDay objects (6 weeks)
- Implemented getTasksForDate(tasks, date) filtering tasks by due date
- Added hasOverdueTasks helper for overdue indicator support
- Files changed: src/utils/calendarUtils.ts, src/utils/calendarUtils.test.ts
- 16 unit tests covering all utilities
- Gotcha: Use `new Date(year, month, day)` in tests to avoid timezone issues with ISO strings
