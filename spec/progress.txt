# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress, learnings, and patterns discovered across Ralph iterations.
Each iteration should APPEND to this file, never overwrite.

---

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- 
  Add patterns discovered about this codebase here.
  Future iterations read this section FIRST.
-->

- **Component Style:** React functional components with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State Management:** React useState/useContext (no external state library)
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Exports:** Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports

---

## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
  Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
  Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Remember to run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Tailwind dynamic classes need to be in safelist or use full class names
- This project uses path aliases: `@/` maps to `src/`

## 2026-01-23 - US-001
- Installed dependencies: dexie, date-fns, react-hot-toast
- Files changed: package.json, package-lock.json
- All packages added successfully to dependencies
- npm run typecheck passes

## 2026-01-23 16:15 - US-002
- Defined TypeScript types in src/types/index.ts
- Added Priority type: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
- Added FilterType type: 'current' | 'overdue' | 'completed'
- Added Task interface with all required fields (id, title, description, completed, priority, dueDate, estimatedMinutes, consumedMinutes, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Files changed: src/types/index.ts, spec/prd.json
- npm run typecheck passes
- Pattern: All types exported from single index.ts file for clean imports

## 2026-01-23 16:16 - US-003
- Created Dexie database in src/db/index.ts
- Database name: todoApp
- Table: tasks with auto-increment id
- Indexes: completed, priority, dueDate, createdAt
- Created comprehensive tests in src/db/index.test.ts
- Files changed: src/db/index.ts, src/db/index.test.ts, src/test/setup.ts, package.json
- Added fake-indexeddb for testing IndexedDB in Node environment
- Pattern: Boolean fields cannot be directly queried in IndexedDB, use filter() instead
- npm run typecheck passes
- npm run test passes (8/8 tests)

## 2026-01-23 16:19 - US-004
- Created useTasks hook in src/hooks/useTasks.tsx
- Returns tasks, isLoading, addTask, updateTask, deleteTask, toggleComplete
- Uses useLiveQuery from dexie-react-hooks for reactive task updates
- addTask creates tasks with auto timestamps and default priority of medium
- deleteTask and toggleComplete show toast notifications with Undo button (5s duration)
- Undo functionality restores deleted tasks or reverts completion state
- Files changed: src/hooks/useTasks.tsx, src/hooks/useTasks.test.tsx, package.json
- Added dexie-react-hooks dependency
- Pattern: Hooks with JSX (toast render functions) must use .tsx extension
- Pattern: Toast undo buttons use inline styles with purple accent color (#a78bfa)
