## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Tailwind dynamic classes need safelist or full class names
- Path alias: `@/` maps to `src/`
- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` before calling a story done
