# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress, learnings, and patterns discovered across Ralph iterations.
Each iteration should APPEND to this file, never overwrite.

---

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- 
  Add patterns discovered about this codebase here.
  Future iterations read this section FIRST.
-->

- **Component Style:** React functional components with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State Management:** React useState/useContext (no external state library)
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Exports:** Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports

---

## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
  Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
  Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Remember to run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Tailwind dynamic classes need to be in safelist or use full class names
- This project uses path aliases: `@/` maps to `src/`

## 2026-01-25 10:56 - US-001
- Removed estimatedMinutes and consumedMinutes from Task interface
- Removed time field references from MainLayout.tsx task creation
- Skipped 4 time-related tests in TaskRow.test.tsx (will be deleted in US-005)
- Files changed: src/types/index.ts, src/components/MainLayout.tsx, src/components/TaskRow.test.tsx
- typecheck and test both pass
- Gotcha: US-001 acceptance criteria required typecheck to pass, necessitating fixes in MainLayout and test skips
