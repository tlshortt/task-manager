# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress, learnings, and patterns discovered across Ralph iterations.
Each iteration should APPEND to this file, never overwrite.

---

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- 
  Add patterns discovered about this codebase here.
  Future iterations read this section FIRST.
-->

- **Component Style:** React functional components with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State Management:** React useState/useContext (no external state library)
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Exports:** Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports

---

## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
  Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
  Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Remember to run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Tailwind dynamic classes need to be in safelist or use full class names
- This project uses path aliases: `@/` maps to `src/`
