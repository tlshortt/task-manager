# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress, learnings, and patterns discovered across Ralph iterations.
Each iteration should APPEND to this file, never overwrite.

---

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- 
  Add patterns discovered about this codebase here.
  Future iterations read this section FIRST.
-->

- **Component Style:** React functional components with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State Management:** React useState/useContext (no external state library)
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Exports:** Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports

---

## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
  Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
  Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Remember to run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Tailwind dynamic classes need to be in safelist or use full class names
- This project uses path aliases: `@/` maps to `src/`

-->
## 2026-01-25 10:56 - US-001
- Removed estimatedMinutes and consumedMinutes from Task interface
- Removed time field references from MainLayout.tsx task creation
- Skipped 4 time-related tests in TaskRow.test.tsx (will be deleted in US-005)
- Files changed: src/types/index.ts, src/components/MainLayout.tsx, src/components/TaskRow.test.tsx
- typecheck and test both pass
- Gotcha: US-001 acceptance criteria required typecheck to pass, necessitating fixes in MainLayout and test skips

## 2026-01-25 11:26 - US-002
- Deleted 5 unused time-related component files
- Removed exports from src/components/index.ts
- Files deleted: ProgressBar.tsx, TimeDisplay.tsx, TimeDisplay.test.tsx, TaskSkeleton.tsx, TaskTableHeader.tsx
- Files changed: src/components/index.ts
- typecheck and test both pass (121 passed, 4 skipped)
- Clean deletion with no breaking changes

## 2026-01-25 11:28 - US-003
- Removed formatTime and parseTime functions from dateUtils.ts
- Removed formatTime and parseTime tests from dateUtils.test.ts (16 test cases removed)
- Files changed: src/utils/dateUtils.ts, src/utils/dateUtils.test.ts
- typecheck and test both pass (101 passed, 4 skipped)
- Test count reduced from 121 to 101 after removing time utility tests

## 2026-01-25 11:29 - US-004
- Verified MainLayout no longer sets time fields during task creation
- Time fields were already removed in US-001, this task verified completion
- No files changed (work already done)
- typecheck and test both pass (101 passed, 4 skipped)
- Learning: US-004 was effectively completed during US-001, just needed verification and PRD update

## 2026-01-25 11:34 - US-005
- Deleted 4 skipped time-related tests from TaskRow.test.tsx
- Tests removed: time display, missing time values, estimated time edit, consumed time edit
- Files changed: src/components/TaskRow.test.tsx
- typecheck and test both pass (101 passed, 0 skipped)
- Test count remains at 101 after cleanup (removed skipped tests)
## 2026-01-25 11:37 - US-006
- Added description input to TaskInput with collapsible UI
- Added FileText icon and "Note" toggle button
- Textarea hidden by default, revealed on toggle click
- Updated onAddTask signature to accept description parameter
- Description passed as 5th parameter, undefined if empty
- Updated 4 TaskInput test assertions for new signature
- Files changed: src/components/TaskInput.tsx, src/components/TaskInput.test.tsx
- typecheck and test both pass (101 passed)
- Pattern: Followed existing collapsible UI pattern (date/tag pickers)
## 2026-01-25 11:45 - US-007
- Updated MainLayout handleAddTask signature to accept description parameter
- Description now passed from TaskInput to addTask via MainLayout
- Changed handleAddTask from 4 to 5 parameters (added description?: string)
- Description passed to addTask call instead of hardcoded undefined
- Files changed: src/components/MainLayout.tsx
- typecheck and test both pass (101 passed)
- Pattern: Simple parameter addition - TaskInput already sending description, just needed to wire through MainLayout
