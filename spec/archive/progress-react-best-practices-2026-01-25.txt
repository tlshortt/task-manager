# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress, learnings, and patterns discovered across Ralph iterations.
Each iteration should APPEND to this file, never overwrite.

---

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- 
  Add patterns discovered about this codebase here.
  Future iterations read this section FIRST.
-->

- **Component Style:** React functional components with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State Management:** React useState/useContext (no external state library)
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Exports:** Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports
- **Imports:** Prefer direct imports for tree-shakable libraries (e.g. lucide-react)
- **Performance:** Use useMemo/useCallback for expensive ops and handlers passed to children

## Gotchas & Warnings

<!--
  Add things that caused issues or took extra time.
  Helps future iterations avoid the same mistakes.
-->

- Remember to run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Tailwind dynamic classes need to be in safelist or use full class names
- This project uses path aliases: `@/` maps to `src/`

## 2026-01-25 15:14 - US-REF-01
- Verified useTaskForm hook already exists and is properly integrated
- Files: src/hooks/useTaskForm.ts, src/components/TaskInput.tsx
- Hook extracts: title, description, dueDate, showDatePicker, showTagPicker, showDescription, priority, tags, newTagName states
- Also extracts: handleSubmit, addTag, removeTag, handleDateChange, handleEscape actions
- Typecheck passes, all 117 tests pass
- Pattern: Hook returns { formState, setters, actions } object for clean destructuring

## 2026-01-25 15:17 - ALL STORIES VERIFIED COMPLETE
- Verified all 10 user stories are already implemented
- US-REF-01: useTaskForm hook exists in src/hooks/useTaskForm.ts
- US-REF-02: EditableText component exists in src/components/EditableText.tsx, used in TaskRow
- US-001: All lucide-react imports use direct paths (lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/*)
- US-002: EmptyState and KeyboardShortcutsModal lazy loaded in MainLayout
- US-004: getFilterCounts uses reduce for single-pass counting
- US-005: MainLayout handlers memoized with useCallback
- US-006: getPriorityColor and PRIORITIES hoisted outside TaskRow
- US-007: useKeyboardShortcuts uses destructured handlers in deps
- US-008: sortDateGroups uses .toSorted()
- US-009: TaskRow has contentVisibility: 'auto' style
- Typecheck passes, all 117 tests pass
- Marked all stories as passes: true in prd.json
